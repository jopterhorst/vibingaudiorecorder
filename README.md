# Vibing Audio Recorder Widget

A powerful Mendix pluggable widget that enables users to record audio directly from their microphone and automatically store it as base64 data in any string attribute. Perfect for voice notes, audio feedback, documentation, and user-generated audio content.

## Features

üé§ **Direct Microphone Recording** - Record audio directly in your Mendix app using the browser's MediaRecorder API  
üìù **Base64 Conversion** - Automatically converts recorded audio to base64 format for easy storage  
üíæ **Flexible Storage** - Store audio in any string attribute of your context object  
üîß **Action Integration** - Trigger custom microflows/nanoflows after recording completes  
üéØ **Modern UI** - Beautiful gradient design with real-time waveform visualization  
‚è±Ô∏è **Built-in Timer** - Shows recording duration in MM:SS format  
üåä **Live Waveform** - Real-time audio waveform animation that responds to sound levels  
üîí **Privacy Focused** - Properly releases microphone access after recording  
üì± **Browser Compatible** - Works with modern browsers supporting MediaRecorder API  
‚ö° **No Dependencies** - Pure implementation without external audio libraries  

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the widget** to any page with an object as context (e.g., Customer, Order, Document, etc.)
2. **Configure the properties**:
   - **Audio Content Attribute**: Select a string attribute where the base64 audio will be stored
   - **Audio Format**: Choose between WebM (smaller files) or WAV (better compatibility)
   - **On Change Action**: Select a microflow/nanoflow to execute after recording
3. **Recording workflow**:
   - User clicks "Record" ‚Üí microphone access requested and recording starts
   - User clicks "Stop Recording" ‚Üí recording stops and processing begins
   - Audio is automatically converted to base64 and stored in the selected attribute
   - OnChange action is triggered if configured
   - Microphone access is properly released

### Example Configuration

```
Context Object: Services_Integration.VibeFile
Audio Content Attribute: VibeFile.AudioBase64
Audio Format: WebM (or WAV for better compatibility)
On Change Action: ACT_ProcessAudioFile
```

### Processing Audio Data

After recording, you can access the base64 audio data in your microflows and convert it to a file:

#### Required Module
First, download and import the **CommunityCommons** module from the Mendix Marketplace, which provides the necessary file conversion actions.

#### Step-by-Step File Conversion

```
Input Parameter: $VibeFile (or your entity with the base64 audio data)
Audio Data: $VibeFile/AudioBase64

// Step 1: Convert base64 to FileDocument using CommunityCommons
// Use the "Base64DecodeToFile" action from CommunityCommons module
// - Input: $VibeFile/AudioBase64 (the base64 string)
// - Input: A FileDocument to be filled
// - Output: FileDocument with the audio content

// Step 2: Set the file extension based on your selected format
// For WebM format: set extension to .webm
// For WAV format: set extension to .wav
// Set the FileDocument.Name to something like: "recording_" + currentDateTime + ".webm" (or ".wav")

// Step 3: Save and use the FileDocument
// Now you have a proper FileDocument that can be:
// - Downloaded by users
// - Stored in your database
// - Used in other microflows
// - Played back using HTML5 audio players
```

#### Example Microflow Steps

1. **Create a FileDocument object**
   - Return: `$NewFileDocument`

2. **Call CommunityCommons.Base64DecodeToFile**
   - Parameter 1: `$VibeFile/AudioBase64`
   - Parameter 2: `$NewFileDocument`
   - Return: `Boolean`

3. **Change Object** (set file properties)
   - Object: `$NewFileDocument`
   - Set `Name` to: `'recording_' + toString([%CurrentDateTime%]) + '.webm'` (or `.wav` based on your format selection)
   - Set other properties as needed

5. **Commit Object**
   - Object: `$NewFileDocument`

6. **Further Processing** (optional)
   - Download file, send via email, store in cloud, etc.

## Demo Project

Clone this repository and import the widget into your Mendix project to see it in action. The widget works with any entity that has a string attribute for storing the base64 audio content.

## Technical Details

- **Audio Formats**: WebM (with Opus codec) or WAV (uncompressed)
- **Storage Format**: Base64 string
- **File Extensions**: `.webm` or `.wav` (must be set manually when creating FileDocument)
- **File Size**: 
  - WebM: ~1KB per second (compressed)
  - WAV: ~10KB per second (uncompressed)
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions with MediaRecorder API)
- **Format Compatibility**:
  - WebM: Better compression, smaller files, good browser support
  - WAV: Larger files, better compatibility with audio software
- **Permissions**: Requires user consent for microphone access
- **Dependencies**: CommunityCommons module required for base64 to file conversion

## Browser Compatibility
