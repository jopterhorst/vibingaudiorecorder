## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the widget** to any page with an object as context (e.g., Customer, Order, Document, etc.)
2. **Configure the properties**:
   - **Audio Content Attribute**: Select a string attribute where the base64 audio will be stored
   - **On Change Action**: Select a microflow/nanoflow to execute after recording
3. **Recording workflow**:
   - User clicks "Record" ‚Üí microphone access requested and recording starts
   - User clicks "Stop Recording" ‚Üí recording stops and processing begins
   - Audio is automatically converted to base64 and stored in the selected attribute
   - OnChange action is triggered if configured
   - Microphone access is properly released

### Example Configuration

```
Context Object: Services_Integration.VibeFile
Audio Content Attribute: VibeFile.AudioBase64
On Change Action: ACT_ProcessAudioFile
```

### Processing Audio Data

After recording, you can access the base64 audio data in your microflows and convert it to a file:

#### Required Module
First, download and import the **CommunityCommons** module from the Mendix Marketplace, which provides the necessary file conversion actions.

#### Step-by-Step File Conversion

```
Input Parameter: $VibeFile (or your entity with the base64 audio data)
Audio Data: $VibeFile/AudioBase64

// Step 1: Convert base64 to FileDocument using CommunityCommons
// Use the "Base64DecodeToFile" action from CommunityCommons module
// - Input: $VibeFile/AudioBase64 (the base64 string)
// - Input: A FileDocument to be filled
// - Output: FileDocument with the audio content

// Step 2: Set the file extension for WebM format
// Set the FileDocument.Name to something like: "recording_" + currentDateTime + ".webm"

// Step 3: Save and use the FileDocument
// Now you have a proper FileDocument that can be:
// - Downloaded by users
// - Stored in your database
// - Used in other microflows
// - Played back using HTML5 audio players
```

#### Example Microflow Steps

1. **Create a FileDocument object**
   - Return: `$NewFileDocument`

2. **Call CommunityCommons.Base64DecodeToFile**
   - Parameter 1: `$VibeFile/AudioBase64`
   - Parameter 2: `$NewFileDocument`
   - Return: `Boolean`

3. **Change Object** (set file properties)
   - Object: `$NewFileDocument`
   - Set `Name` to: `'recording_' + toString([%CurrentDateTime%]) + '.webm'`
   - Set other properties as needed

5. **Commit Object**
   - Object: `$NewFileDocument`

6. **Further Processing** (optional)
   - Download file, send via email, store in cloud, etc.
