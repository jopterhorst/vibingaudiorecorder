# Audio Recorder Widget for Mendix

A powerful Mendix pluggable widget that enables users to record audio directly from their microphone and automatically store it as base64 data in any string attribute. Perfect for voice notes, audio feedback, documentation, and user-generated audio content.

## Features

üé§ **Direct Microphone Recording** - Record audio directly in your Mendix app using the browser's MediaRecorder API  
üìù **Base64 Conversion** - Automatically converts recorded audio to base64 format for easy storage  
üíæ **Flexible Storage** - Store audio in any string attribute of your context object  
üîß **Action Integration** - Trigger custom microflows/nanoflows after recording completes  
üéØ **Clean UI** - Simple record/stop interface with processing feedback  
üîí **Privacy Focused** - Properly releases microphone access after recording  
üì± **Browser Compatible** - Works with modern browsers supporting MediaRecorder API  
‚ö° **No Dependencies** - Pure implementation without external audio libraries  

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the widget** to any page with an object as context (e.g., Customer, Order, Document, etc.)
2. **Configure the properties**:
   - **Audio Content Attribute**: Select a string attribute where the base64 audio will be stored
   - **On Change Action**: (Optional) Select a microflow/nanoflow to execute after recording
3. **Recording workflow**:
   - User clicks "Record" ‚Üí microphone access requested and recording starts
   - User clicks "Stop Recording" ‚Üí recording stops and processing begins
   - Audio is automatically converted to base64 and stored in the selected attribute
   - OnChange action is triggered if configured
   - Microphone access is properly released

### Example Configuration

```
Context Object: Services_Integration.VibeFile
Audio Content Attribute: VibeFile.AudioBase64
On Change Action: ACT_ProcessAudioFile
```

### Processing Audio Data

After recording, you can access the base64 audio data in your microflows:

```
Input Parameter: $VibeFile (or your entity)
Audio Data: $VibeFile/AudioBase64

// Example processing:
// 1. Convert base64 to binary using Java actions
// 2. Create FileDocument with proper file extension
// 3. Set metadata (name, size, creation date)
// 4. Save to database or trigger additional workflows
```
